Algorithm Implementation:
i) Gossip based group communication(Gossip)
ii) Gossip based PushSum for computation of aggregate(PuhSum)

Network Topologies:
i)Line ii) 3DGrid iii) Imperfect3DGrid iv) FullNetwork

Project2.scala is the main program that starts the protocol.
Master.scala is the master actor that instantiates all the participating nodes(actors), and initializes their neighborsList.
Worker.scala implements the nodes participating in the Gossip Protocol.


To run the program:
cd to the directory from the terminal.

>cd Gossip_PushSum

>sbt

>run numberOfNodes Topology algorithm

numberOfNodes can be: 100, 1000 etc.

Topology can be: Line, 3DGrid, Imperfect3DGrid, FullNetwork

algorithm can be: gossip, pushsum

Example: run 1000 3DGrid Pushsum
